# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-Project

This project is divided into four different parts. The first is data exploration where I import and query in SQL the Covid-19 deaths data from Excel.

The second part of my project visualizes the data using tableau commands and functions.

The third part of my project cleans the data in SQL.

The fourth part of my project aims to find correlations within the data using Python.
