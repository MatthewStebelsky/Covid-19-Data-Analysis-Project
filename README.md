# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-Project

This project is divided into two different parts. The first is data exploration where I import and query the Covid-19 deaths data from Excel using mySQL.

Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

The second part of my project visualizes the data using tableau. I'll find a way to embed this into Github in the near future.
